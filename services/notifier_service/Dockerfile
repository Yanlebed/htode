    libatk1.0-0 \
    libatk-bridge2.0-0 \

WORKDIR /app

# 2) Copy your shared "common" folder (which includes phone_parser, etc.)
COPY common /app/common

# 3) Copy your specific service code
COPY services/notifier_service/app /app/app

# 4) Copy requirements and install
COPY services/notifier_service/requirements.txt /app/requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# 5) Install Playwright + Browsers
#    A) pip install playwright (whatever version you like)
#    B) Then run "playwright install --with-deps chromium"
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir playwright==1.36.0
RUN playwright install --with-deps chromium

# Optionally, you can set an environment variable so Playwright knows
#   where to store the browser binaries, or if you want them in the final image
# e.g.: ENV PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/ms-playwright

# 6) Set PYTHONPATH
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app/common

# 7) Final command (Celery worker for the Notifier queue)
CMD ["celery", "-A", "app.tasks", "worker", "--loglevel=info", "--queues=notify_queue"]
